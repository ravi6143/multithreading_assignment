Multithreading allows developers to write programs with a modular                                            structure, where different tasks are encapsulated within separate threads.                                    This can make the code more organized, easier to understand, and                                               maintainable\n",

    "3.  When multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, proper                                           synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores, are necessary to                                     ensure data integrity and avoid race conditions. Implementing and                                             managing these synchronization mechanisms can introduce additional                                           complexity and overhead.\n",
    "4. Multithreading is most effective when dealing with tasks that involve I/O                                     operations or waiting for external resources. However, on CPU-bound tasks                                     that require significant processing power, the benefits of multithreading                                     might be limited. This is due to the inherent limitations of parallel                                         execution on a single CPU or core. "

    "Deadlock:\n",
    "A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads or processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource. In other words, it's a state in which each thread is blocked and waiting for a resource that another thread holds, resulting in a standstill. Deadlocks typically occur due to a lack of proper synchronization or resource allocation management. Deadlocks can be quite problematic as they can cause a program to hang or become unresponsive.\n",

    "Race Condition:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when two or more threads or processes access shared data simultaneously, and the final outcome of the program depends on the order of execution of those threads. The result of the program becomes unpredictable because the threads \"race\" to access and modify shared resources without proper synchronization. Race conditions can lead to incorrect calculations, data corruption, or other unexpected behaviors in the program."
